**Coal**esce your repositories.
So I don't have to remember paths or aliases anymore when I want to work on a project.

# TODO

- [x] List repositories in TUI with information section for that repository on the RHS of the screen
- [x] Open new shell with the repository as cwd
- [x] Open lazygit with the repository as cwd
- [x] Open editor (neovim currently) with the repository as cwd
- [ ] RHS shows branch and latest commit message as well as author
- [ ] Get default editor from environment, probably $EDITOR
- [ ] Style everything make it look prettier
- [ ] Way to add repositories to tracking from the TUI.
